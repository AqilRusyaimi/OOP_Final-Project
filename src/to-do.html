            <h2>Weather</h2>
            <p>Skydiving is one of the most weather-dependent sports in the world.

                Especially for beginners. If you’re a newbie pilot you’re not allowed to 
                jump in anything above a mild wind – as it makes landing harder. As a tandem 
                this is similar, but mostly because all that weight makes the canopy harder to fly.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Food</h2>
            <p>It’s important to eat the right stuff when you’re jumping for the first time. 
                Your stomach will be a little more ‘awake’ than usual when you’re leaping out 
                of a plane!
                <br><br>
                As I said above, try to avoid big meals that could make you a little travel sick. 
                While flying through the air is total freedom, being couped up in a little plane isn’t. 
                Opt for a good healthy breakfast and snacks to keep you going.</p>

        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Clothes</h2>
            <p>Tandem skydiving doesn’t require you to purchase any fancy skydiving suit or special gear. 
                Most drop zones will provide you with all of the safety equipment you need for a successful 
                jump. Make sure you wear athletic clothing that’s comfortable and snug. Wear closed-toed 
                shoes that don’t slip off and be sure to remove loose jewelry and accessories.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>Packages</h2>
            <p>Pricing is always important, but it’s important to look at what’s included with that price as 
                well. Check for a good price that includes all gear and safety equipment. Also, look for good 
                photo and video packages that aren’t at astronomical prices. Also, be sure to check for special 
                skydiving deals that may only be available on certain sites.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-box">
            <h2>What to bring</h2>
            <p>When you’re packing up for your skydiving adventure make sure you’re only taking what’s absolutely 
                necessary. Make sure you have a form of payment and a photo ID to prove your age. You can bring your 
                phone to the dropzone, but you likely won’t be able to take it with you on the actual skydive. Many 
                dropzones offer photo & video packages with equipment that they provide, so you won’t have to worry 
                about bringing a camera or gopro to capture the experience.</p>
